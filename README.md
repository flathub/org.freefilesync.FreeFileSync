## Maintaining this repository

The workflow for building a new release `REL` is:
```sh
# Create a new git branch for release REL (e.g. "11.0", adjust the version)
REL=11.0
git fetch
git switch -c release-${REL} origin/beta

# Adjust the manifest:
# 1) In the 'freefilesync' module, update `url`, `sha256` and `size`.
# 2) For other modules (dependencies), check if there are newer releases available and update them.
your-favorite-editor org.freefilesync.FreeFileSync.yml

# Update the appdata: Create a new `<release>` tag.
your-favorite-editor data/org.freefilesync.FreeFileSync.appdata.xml

# Update shared modules
cd shared-modules
git pull
cd ..

# Build and install. The installation part is necessary, because due to extra-data approach (see
# manifest), the actual FFS binary is downloaded and processed only during installation.
flatpak-builder builddir org.freefilesync.FreeFileSync.yml --force-clean --ccache --install --user

# Test the app. Your dev version should be installed as the 'master' branch, so if you have the
# stable version installed as well, you must distinguish them as shown below. Check your
# 'flatpak list --app' output to make sure.
flatpak run org.freefilesync.FreeFileSync//master

# Remove the dev version of the app
flatpak remove org.freefilesync.FreeFileSync//master

# Commit the changes
git add -u
git diff --cached
git commit -m "upstream release ${REL}"
git push -u origin release-${REL}
# Submit the pull request now (against the beta branch) through GitHub

# After the PR is approved, merge it into the beta branch
git switch beta
git merge --ff-only release-${REL}
git push

# If there are no issues with beta, update the master branch
# Create a new PR through GitHub:
# https://github.com/flathub/org.freefilesync.FreeFileSync/compare/master...beta
# After it is approved:
git switch master
git merge --ff-only beta
git tag -a -m "release ${REL}" v${REL}
git push --follow-tags

# Remove old branches
git branch -d release-${REL}
git push -d origin release-${REL}
```
